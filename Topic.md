### Suggestions for Coding Practicals

To build practical knowledge, focus on hands-on coding exercises tied to each topic. Start with basics and progress to projects. Use the repo's examples as a base, then extend them. Here's a list of suggested practicals (one or more per topic) with brief descriptions. Aim to code each in a dedicated folder, test thoroughly, and version control with Git.

1. **Introduction to Node.js**: Create a "Hello World" script that logs system info using `process` and runs in REPL.

2. **Node.js Basics**: Build a custom module that exports functions for math operations (e.g., add, multiply) and import it in another file.

3. **NPM**: Initialize a project with `npm init`, install a package like `lodash`, and write a script that uses it for array manipulation.

4. **File System Module**: Write a program that reads a JSON file, modifies data, and writes it back to a new file.

5. **HTTP Module**: Create a basic HTTP server that serves static HTML pages and handles GET/POST requests for a simple form.

6. **Express.js Framework**: Build a mini-blog app with routes for home, about, and contact pages using Express.

7. **Advanced Express**: Add middleware for logging requests and use EJS to render dynamic templates for a user profile page.

8. **Databases with Node.js**: Set up a MongoDB connection, create a schema for "users," and perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations via a Node.js script.

9. **Authentication**: Implement user registration and login with bcrypt for password hashing and sessions for persistence.

10. **REST APIs**: Develop a REST API for a "tasks" app with endpoints for listing, adding, updating, and deleting tasks, using Postman for testing.

11. **Real-Time Applications**: Build a simple chat app using Socket.io where users can send messages in real-time.

12. **Testing and Debugging**: Write unit tests for a calculator module using Mocha and Chai, including edge cases.

13. **Deployment and Production**: Deploy your Express app to Heroku, configure environment variables, and set up PM2 for process management.
