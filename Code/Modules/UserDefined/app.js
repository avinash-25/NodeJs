//! Modules ===>  It is a logical piece of code which can be used anywhere. It helps us to write clean and manageable code.

//? It helps down to breakdown complex problems into simple ones
//? using modules we can organize the code and also could solve the errors more easily.
//? It helps us to avoid DRY (Don't repeat yourself) principle.

//todo ==> import(un-packing) and export(packing)
// we have two standards formats.

//? 1. commonJS modules :
//require() : for import
//exports : for export
//(nodejs used commonJS modules by -default )

//? 2. ES modules (ESM)  : import and export.
