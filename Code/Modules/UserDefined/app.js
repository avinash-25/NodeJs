//! Modules ===>  It is a logical piece of code which can be used anywhere. It helps us to write clean and manageable code.

//? It helps down to breakdown complex problems into simple ones
//? using modules we can organize the code and also could solve the errors more easily.
//? It helps us to avoid DRY (Don't repeat yourself) principle.

//todo ==> import(un-packing) and export(packing)
// we have two standards formats.

//? 1. commonJS modules :
//require() : for import
//exports : for export
//(nodejs used commonJS modules by -default )

//? 2. ES modules (ESM)  : import and export.


//! I nodejs there has a three types of node modules

//? 1) User defiened : there is defiened by users ane can be imported and exported where-ever needded.

//? 2) built-in :  these are also called as core- modules, which are part of nodeJS installation.
//?  i.e, we dont need to install or write the code from scratch. (import and use).
// example ===> fs, http, path, crypto, os etc..
